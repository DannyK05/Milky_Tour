          We've arrived at the crown jewel of the solar system — Saturn. Even
          from here, its shimmering halo of rings glitters against the darkness,
          like a royal diadem worn by the most elegant monarch in space. At over
          120,000 kilometers wide, Saturn&apos; rings make it impossible to
          mistake for any other planet.

          content="These are not just rings — they're millions of icy shards,  
    from dust-sized grains to chunks as big as mountains, all orbiting in delicate balance.  
    Some scientists believe they may be the remains of a shattered moon,  
    others think they've been here since the dawn of the solar system.  
    Whatever their origin, they form a cosmic symphony of ice and light."

          image={Titan}
          content="Meet Titan, Saturn' largest moon and one of the most intriguing worlds we know.  
    Beneath its thick, orange atmosphere of nitrogen lies a landscape carved by rivers and lakes —  
    not of water, but of liquid methane and ethane.  
    It' a frozen realm with weather, seasons, and the tantalizing possibility of exotic life."

        <FactLayout
          image={Cassini}
          content="And here' a tribute to one of humanity' boldest explorers — the Cassini spacecraft.  
    For 13 years it orbited Saturn, revealing its storms, moons, and hidden secrets.  
    In 2017, it made a final, breathtaking dive into Saturn' atmosphere —  
    a deliberate plunge to avoid contaminating Titan or Enceladus,  
    ending its mission with a blaze of data and glory."

        <p className="greet">
          We'll ride Saturn&apos; gravitational pull as our next cosmic
          slingshot, hurling us toward the pale-blue enigma of Uranus. Keep your
          eyes on those rings as they fade into the distance — beauty like that
          deserves a long, last look.
