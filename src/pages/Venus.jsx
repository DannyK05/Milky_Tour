                <p className="special">Hold on tight, folks! We're zipping past Venus at breakneck speed, and here's a little secret: we're using its gravitational force for a boost. It's like catching a cosmic wave, allowing us to surf through space more efficiently and save on fuel. Efficiency is the name of the game in space tourism!</p>
                <p className="special">Now that Venus is in our rearview mirrors, get ready for the next leg of our Milky Tour. Fasten your seat belts and brace yourselves as we journey deeper into the cosmic wonders.</p>
