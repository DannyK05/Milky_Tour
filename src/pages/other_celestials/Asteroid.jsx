          Hold on tight, travelers — our Milky Tour now carries us into the
          mysterious expanse between Mars and Jupiter: the Asteroid Belt.
          Imagine a region where countless rocky bodies, from pebble-sized
          shards to mountain-sized giants, drift in an endless ballet around the
          Sun. Contrary to the wild scenes in sci-fi movies, the asteroids here
          are spaced far apart… but trust me, you still wouldn't want to take
          your helmet off.

          content="There's Ceres, the largest object in the belt and officially a dwarf planet. Spanning about 940 km (584 miles) across, it's big enough to hold water ice beneath its surface — a shimmering treasure in the midst of a dusty wasteland."

          Steering through the belt requires the precision of a master pilot.
          Fortunately, Orion 3's navigation systems are charting a safe, elegant
          path — weaving between tumbling boulders and silent monoliths. The
          ride is smooth, but keep your cameras ready: you never know when a
          tumbling asteroid might glide past, silhouetted against the distant
          Sun.
